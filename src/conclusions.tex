\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}



Create a context-aware instrumentation in order to avoid updates to the global counter inside function calls in tight loops, for which function cloning could be employed.
\textbf{Elaborate}

Merge probes in branches with similar work value.
\textbf{Elaborate}

Perform a loop-aware relaxation which is able to considering inner loops where the upper bound of the trip count is known.
\textbf{Elaborate}

Use the work-based metric with the work instrumentation in order to perform run-time auto-tuning or multi-versioning optimisations.
